### The Water Cycle
- Overview of how water moves between land, sea, and air.
- Prepares students to understand weather patterns.

### Evaporation
- Sunlight heats water, turning it into vapor.
- Vapor rises into the sky.

### Condensation
- Vapor cools and forms tiny droplets (clouds).
- Clouds gather until they’re heavy enough to drop rain.

### Precipitation
- Water falls back to Earth as rain or snow.
- Completes the cycle and fills rivers and lakes.
